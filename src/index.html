                    After class today, half of the class and I immediately dropped our things at home and bolted to Christiansborg Palace! We wanted to visit and it closed at 5, and since we got out at 2:30 we figured it'd be the perfect amount of time. We got to walk through the royal stables, the royal kitchen, and rooms of the palace, as well as the ruins that were under the castle and were a little bit creepy, which was probably to be expected. The palace was beautiful and bigger than I expected, and they made us wear plastic caps on our shoes so we didn't scuff the floors. We also climbed the tower of the castle and got to look out over all of Copenhagen and could even see Sweden! Afterwards we went to a three story food court that was way cleaner and nicer than any food court I've seen in the US, and also probably more expensive than you'd expect from a food court. I got a really good chicken gyro that came with fries, and they also put fries inside the gyro itself which I think was probably a ploy to get Americans to buy it. It worked though because I bought it.

                    Today was our first full day of regular class with no extra trips, excursions, or events! We have 3 hours of class every day split into 1.5 hour chunks, and usually have an hour or so for lunch in the middle. Today's lunch was spent eating lunch at home and playing go-fish with my housemates for whatever reason (I won). After class we went shopping on StrÃ¸get, the shopping street near our house, and tried out some European stores. I bought two tops at a store called Monki which was like H&M but better, and we found an IKEA for only homegoods called SÃ¸strene Grene that I fell in love with!!

                    This was our first free day in a while! I spent most of the day relaxing after being up so early every other day of the week, and then headed to the Copenhagen public library around the corner to do some homework and study. I cooked salmon for dinner and a group of us watched Hereditary, which was plenty freaky.

                      This morning we woke up in Aarhus and had hotel breakfast! It was a pretty, but lackluster, spread and it was here I learned that they have really thin pieces of milk or dark chocolate that you can just put on bread as your breakfast. Groundbreaking. We then walked over to the Aarhus art museum, where we had a guided tour by a museum employee who told us about some Danish context to the paintings and art pieces we saw, which was really cool. We then took photos in the museum's 360 rainbow panorama, which was a big circle pathway on top of the building with each panel of window tinted a different color, which let you see each angle of the city from a different color. It was great for photos! From the art museum, we rode over to the history museum and had lunch, where I had chicken tartlets for the first time. It was like chicken pot pie, but with a thicker crust and an open top. We walked through the history museum and learned about Viking history and explored their Day of the Dead exhibit, which I found interesting for a Danish museum. We then hopped on the bus once more to ride back to Copenhagen!

                      We woke up at 6:15am this morning to hop on a hot pink bus to Aarhus for the day (and night)! It was a three and a half hour drive through the countryside and we stopped halfway to visit the Jelling stones, which are the stones that were carved/inscribed many years ago to establish Denmark as a country for the first time! It was really cold and raining but our tour guide didn't miss a beat in our 45 minute long outdoor tour. We then hopped back on the bus and went to a mix between a food court and a food truck rodeo-- it was a bunch of food truck looking things, but indoors, and indoor seating as well! We then rode the rest of the way to Aarhus straight to Google's Denmark office and listened to a tech talk from a Google employee named Mads about his role at Google, his experience working for Google in Denmark, and web development. 
                      <br><br>
                      After that, we headed to our hotel in the middle of Aarhus, which was about as tiny as you're allowed to make a hotel room with two twin beds, and left our things there. We wandered around the streets of Aarhus and explored the library there as well, which was beautiful and had some fun interactive architecture outside. We then had dinner at a restaurant that served all of us the same chicken sandwich (but it was really good!) and three scoops of ice cream, which were cinnamon, key lime, and lemon flavored. We then explored the rooftop of a department store which had a glass pathway that hung over the street so that you could look down onto it, and I hated it a lot. But when you weren't standing on a single piece of glass very high in the air, the view was amazing! We then tried out an Irish pub in the city, then headed back to the hotel for the night.

                      This morning was the first morning we could wake up after 8am! We had class at 10am and had a guest lecture from a Danish professor about the culture in Copenhagen and elsewhere in Denmark. I learned that most Danish prisons don't have fences since they're so trusting! I also learned a couple of Danish phrases but I'm only confident enough to use the tiniest ones (such as hej! (hi!) or tak! (thanks!)). For lunch we had hot dogs in Nyhavn with remoulade and crunchy onions on top (my new fav!!) and then walked around Rosenborg Castle's park. We then returned to class, then later that evening headed out to the park to hang out as a big group!

                    To finish up what I started halfway through the 21st, we finished our classtime and a few hours later had an opening dinner at a Mediterannean restaurant called RizRaz which had a buffet! Afterwards, half of the class accompanied me to my first bar as a 21 year old :)
                    <br><br>
                    On the second full day in Denmark, we got up bright and early for a bike tour! It's been about 8 years since I've stepped on a bike, so I was very shaky and not at all prepared to ride alongside the commuting bikers of Copenhagen at 8:30am on a Wednesday. My balance is not as great as it once was, and I only almost crashed ~3 times :) We had a tour guide that brought us around the neighborhoods of Copenhagen and showed us the highlights, and provided stories about the areas as well. The streets are lined with political posters right now because the EU and local elections are coming up (and they aren't allowed to put political ads on TV or other media here, so streets are all they have!) We rode about 5 miles, then stopped for a local pizza lunch, and rode the 2 miles back to the bike rental place. I even led my group's way back to the rental place! 
                    <br><br>
                    Later that night we went to a picnic held by our program, where we got the choice between either weirdly long pork hot dogs or weirdly short chicken hot dogs. Solid experience.

                  Today's my 21st birthday which doesn't mean anything special in Copenhagen! I flew in yesterday overnight, collected exactly 1 hour of sleep, and then immediately hopped on the last bus to the study abroad housing (our flight was an hour late which almost made us miss our bus!!) I then met the program leaders, found my room, and met the other people on the program. We had pizza for dinner and went grocery shopping for the first time after. Everyone talked about how expensive they were, but everything in the store Netto was so cheap!
                  <br><br>
                  This morning I woke up naturally at 6:50am local time, which doesn't make sense because that's 12:50am at home but whatever! We went to an opening ceremony at 8:30am, stopped by a cafe for pastries, and started class afterwards. And that's what you've missed in my life!!
