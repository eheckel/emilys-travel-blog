                  Today's my 21st birthday which doesn't mean anything special in Copenhagen! I flew in yesterday overnight, collected exactly 1 hour of sleep, and then immediately hopped on the last bus to the study abroad housing (our flight was an hour late which almost made us miss our bus!!) I then met the program leaders, found my room, and met the other people on the program. We had pizza for dinner and went grocery shopping for the first time after. Everyone talked about how expensive they were, but everything in the store Netto was so cheap!
                  <br><br>
                  This morning I woke up naturally at 6:50am local time, which doesn't make sense because that's 12:50am at home but whatever! We went to an opening ceremony at 8:30am, stopped by a cafe for pastries, and started class afterwards. And that's what you've missed in my life!!
